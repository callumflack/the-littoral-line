Hello again after a hiatus of some months. I hope you’ve been well. The process of writing this newsletter had become an exercise in blood-letting, so I stopped. I think I was holding it too tightly, without even knowing what I wanted it to be. And I was also knee-deep in project work. So from here on, I’ll write lighter. That’s all I can afford. Yet I have an inkling that a lighter method will allow as much idea refaction with half the effort. Let’s see.

The purpose of this letter is to journal. Whiel I'm a designer, I rarely wish to explicitly think about "design" as a medium per se. Instead, I follow what interests me. 

That said, here’s a few thoughts from some epic recent readings, all of which I recommend to you.

### Eno Edge

### Supersensorium

“We find ourselves strolling the aisles of a vast sensorium. …What had previously been accomplished for food through the distribution of supermarkets has now been done with experience itself.

“our now endless ways of telling “how she loved him”

“Deprived of bottom-up input from the senses, dreaming seems to be the natural state of the brain”
“The connection between dream and wake is so close, in fact, that the transition to wake, if allowed to occur naturally and spontaneously in the absence of alarm clocks, is almost always from REM. It is like an already online consciousness gets off to a running start by swapping out random sources with real input from sensory organs.”

So our hunger for stories helps us to practise dreaming of future circumstances we haven’t yet encountered.

“we’ve explored those horrific experiential landscapes, or ones close enough to them, in the safety of dreams.”

“dreams are the exercise of consciousness.”
“Dreaming, then, isn’t about integrating new memories or processing the day’s events; it’s rather a necessary technique for ensuring a healthy waking consciousness, one that can navigate possible experiences.”

“Shamans, and then storytellers with their myths, and then poets, writers, directors—all external dream makers, producing superior artificial dreams.”

Netflix, then, becomes a supersensorium—a bazaar of infinite dream stories—such that “the biological urge to dream the monomyth grows to eat the world.”

In the end, Heol calls for personal aesthetics as the solution:

“In a world of infinite experience, it is the aesthete who is safest, not the ascetic. Abstinence will not work. The only cure for too much fiction is good fiction.”

Entertainment contains. Art expands.

### My half year review (only 1.5 months late)

I wrote up a short, cathartic half-year review post. Context: I’m a designer who also codes because I think this is the best way to create tangible outcomes in websites. As a freelancer, it becomes easy to take on more work. Yet, especially because I already gave myself two jobs, it’s very easy to have too much to do. The trick I’m learning is to continually search for better people to work with, so I can do less with more focus.

PS. I redid my website again. I’ve finally managed to fully replicate the Jekyll paradigm using Vue.js. I was previously using Nuxt.js (which I use for most of my client projects) but I think blogging needs to be much lighter. Vuepress and Gridsome aren’t quite laser-focused on markdown—the essential writing language in my opinion—and I was frustrated for some months until I stumbled across the excellent Saber framework. So my site is now exactly I’d wished: just a folder of markdown files with a presentation layer (Saber extracts data from the markdown, and gives me all the Vue fun and lighting performance I now take for granted). And all this without any obstacles to future bandwagoning on Vue, of which version 3 is dropping later this year.

PPS. I have much to say about website publishing systems. If anyone has been experimenting with markdown and other JavaScript libraries (anyone using Svelte yet?) or even different languages like this, I’d love to hear about your experiences.

PPPS. Furthermore, publishing relates to writing. I’ve just started a most exciting project where we’ll provide respondent workflows to text blocks.

### That’s a wrap

In Alan Jacobs “Snakes & Ladders” newsletter, he always ends with a status board. I like it, so I’m stealing his idea:

- Family:
- Work:
- Music: I forgot about this record until an old record mate asked if I knew about it. It’s a Desert Island Disc, plain and simple.

There is so much to talk about. Ping me on twitter, or reply back to this email. Your thoughts, tangents, criticism and breakbeats are always welcome.
