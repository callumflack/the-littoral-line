In a recent client project, I provided a design phase to fix some [responsive website layout](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/) issues. After choosing and building the revisions, the client decided to revert back to their current design and not use the work they paid for, despite my objective (ha!) design explanations. I can't say why they chose not to, because there was no reason given, but I'd politely speculate that it was too much effort to understand and decide on the proposed solutions. Which is all quite fair enough except that the issues persist and will, unfortunately, be slowly rediscovered by the client and their audience and so they will have to engage me again with their observations, and we will most likely dance in this circle again. These things happen. It's part of consulting. My point today is _how they happen_.

### Problem definitions and the problem of human communication

Communication between human beings is difficult. Unlike every other animal on Earth, we use language to transmit more than social behaviour cues: we use it to transmit meaning. We feel like it's an automatic part of the natural universe, but it is not. And this hides that fact that all objective truths are each arrived at subjectively.

What you say something to me, I have to a) pay attention to it along some spectrum of care and b) decode what I understand to be the intention of your words. That is, we _guess at meaning_. No transmission of knowledge between humans is perfect. We cannot yet download and execute the "fly a helicopter" program. When I recieve your speech as information I decode it in a way which is naturally unique to me. This is both a feature—because it is the start of creativity—and a bug—because when we wish to collaborate together to solve a problem, we can't be sure we have the same problem in our minds.

<!-- When the Rationalists talk of aiming to be "less wrong", they understand that the process of understanding and creating knowledge is fraught with potholes. -->

The point is that problem definitions and their solutions require clear and specific language—what David Deutsch calls _hard-to-vary explanations_—in the hope of fostering shared understanding. Yet the process of creative thought—the iceberg inbetween understanding the problem definition and proposing solutions—needs rich, unrestricted thinking, a process that begins by doing away with the rigours of explanatory language and instead playing with possibilities, which includes [swimming with the words](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/opinion/oliver-sacks-the-man-who-loved-words.html) themselves.

<!-- The paradox is that language is how we understand ourselves in the world.  -->

> Tell all the truth but tell it slant,<br> Success in circuit lies,<br> Too bright for our infirm delight<br> The truth’s superb surprise;<br> As lightning to the children eased<br> With explanation kind,<br> The truth must dazzle gradually<br> Or every man be blind.<br><span>Emily Dickinson</span>

The truth must dazzle gradually because genuine insight is always surprisingly counterintuitive, and so our beliefs sometimes need time to catch up. It is, ironically, only with the richness of language available within each of us—an internal world created according to our individual whims—that we can think through these seemingly bizarre propositions. When you attempt [richer language](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary), you are creatively reinterpreting and discovering the boundaries of your thinking. It is this practise that can open you up to understanding the counterintuitive explanations that can solve your problems.

<!-- This is why solving a problem always happens with some form of counterintuitive surprise, even if the solution that presents itself exerts in you a minor sigh of "huh, why did't I think of that before" or, "I knew this! How did I miss it?" or even perhaps "sounds good well below that of the "eureka!" double-helix moments. -->

### Meeting minds: consultancy and problem definitions

> Geometry is not true, it is advantageous<span>Henri Poincare</span>

Let me go back to my client project story that I began with. When it comes to collaborating with clients on projects that involve complex systems, like websites, the chances of _miscommunication_ are a function of what language they have to talk about what they see as the problem—which includes all their tacit understanding of web systems—combined with how I meet them at the point of decoding the information they share, using the language I have to listen, understand and re-explain their problem, both to myself and back to them. And this process of mine also includes all my tacit knowledge of web systems. Miscommunication is _bound_ to happen.

Mostly this is because I am fallible and I will underestimate the background knowledge I have and overestimate the background knowledge my clients have. And vice versa from the client's point of view of what I do and again from an understanding of their business domain! So while in the first instance I present myself as a consultant with specific skills—for me, that's to design web stuff and then build it—the most important thing in consulting for clients is _to meet them where they think their problem is_.

> Science, like art, religion, commerce, warfare, and even sleep, is based on presuppositions.<span>Gregory Bateson</span>

<!-- Now let me be an optimist. That they have come to me with a problem they innately understand is the reason for the whole dance in the first place. Our collaboration starts with a common understanding. -->

<!-- Problem solving requires problem defining. If you are consulting for a client, this definition is the bottleneck to the solution.  -->

Trying to figure out what presupposes the problem in the minds of your client is the primary obstacle to any solution a consultant might present. Because I have I've made it quite clear (ha!) that every sentient mind has its own internal models, _where client and consultant meet in a mutual understanding of the problem is a measure of how well the solution will work_. Yes, clients already have their attention spread and they wish to simply buy solutions. The paradox is that until clients can find the attention required to understand the problem in collaboration with the consultant, the consultant is constrained in the solution they can provide.

<!-- As humans continually utter, listen and guess, knowledge is continually collapsing and expanding. The paradox to problem solving is that solutions must be clear and yet exploration and discovery is by necessity _unclear_. One has to be open to poetics. -->

### Symmathesy: collective problem solving in music, art, science, and software

If anything at all has resonated in my rambles on problem definitions and consultancy above, I highly recommend you read Jessica Kerr's [The Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming](https://blog.atomist.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming/) which proposes new ways of thinking about _software as scenius_. That is, people working in the medium of software need a shared understanding of the software system in question before they can affect change within that system. Sound familiar?

> it’s easier to build a system from scratch, constructing the mental model as you go along, than to form an understanding of how an already-built system works.

> [until they] have a mental model of this system … they can’t change the system because they don’t understand it

> Generativity is about growing the team’s output over time, and each member of the team grows at the same time.

> Software is not Art. Software is the next thing after art. It is something new, that we’ve never been able to do before.

> I want to practice symmathesy, to grow as part of a growing system, a system with people of many different skills.

Two words struck me. Jessica uses the word "camerata"—as in [the Florentine Camerata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Camerata)—instead of ["scenius"](https://kk.org/thetechnium/scenius-or-comm/), which is a new angle on the same meaning. And the word ["symmathesy"](https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/symmathesy-a-word-in-progress/) which means _"a learning system made of learning parts"_, and was coined by Nora Bateson, Gregory Bateson's daughter (which really circled out my week, thoroughly enriched!).

### Status board

- **Reading:** I figured I'd start reading some Gregory Bateson alongside _The Master & His Emissary_. But no Kindle edition and some fine stumbling Twitter rabbitholes lead me to two excellent articles on software systems instead: the Jessica Kerr article above and a new James Somers article (always a treat, another of his is also linked above). Read: [The Coming Software Apocalypse](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/).
- **Watching:** Test Cricket is alive and well. Ben Stokes is a superhero and that we (Australia) lost [the unloseable Test](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/49472508) was a damn salty thing to accept, and yet last night's [crab-epic Steve Smith innings](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/49596683) seems to have nullified England, perhaps entirely? Just when he had every right to score less than someone else in the team, Jofra Archer's quiet barbs gave Smith an excuse to double-down on defining what "actions speak louder than words" looks like. And just so you're confirmed in your presupposition, no, my Wife doesn't watch it with me.
- **Music:** All-time favourite [Express Rising](https://youtu.be/eCn5G55Jz54) is back on the platter. And the seriously-good-yet-counterintuitively-outrageously-rare [Ithaca](https://youtu.be/8oMtg25Hzd0) — no I don't own an original. If you do, send it on over thxbye.
- **Work:** The writing app progresses. It's going well because we've had the time and space to properly listen and explain to each other our thoughts and understanding of what the app might constitute. Looking to get a working app live in the next month, because that's where the true learning will occur.

That's a wrap. This one has been longer than I intended. It took 4 hours to wrestle into words what was so clear to me in this morning's shower. _Expect less_ next week.

As always, your thoughts, tweets, tangents, criticism and breakbeats are welcome.
