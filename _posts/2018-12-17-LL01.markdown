Hello to you out there. It's me from over here. Nice to meet you at the replacement for the town square—the glowing rectangle.

Pretend the picture above (taken last weekend in the simmering tropics of Northern Australia) is your seat on the train. You've got a window seat, 5pm sun at your left shoulder so you'll see the last hour of light reach out into the distance until it disappears. Now your phone glows. Turn down the brightness. Find something worth reading. Read on.

I don't know what the Littoral Line is about yet, except that I like “littoral” places—places on the shoreline, occurring at the edge of things, like the last hour of daylight. So I'll sit here with that idea and see where we get to.

Just to be sure, you've probably signed up for this because I told you I was going to do write an email newsletter, so we've probably spoken in a past online thread, or by email, or hell, maybe even in person. I guess the typical designer would write about design industry things. That makes sense. Except I find the majority of those listicles a little boring at the best of times. To give you some context, LL is about design, the web and our attention. What are the patterns of our attention? What captures our attention? Why? Is there room for wonder while we're busy with our lives? I think there is. You can think of LL as a kind of running diary of those times when I notice such things and actually remember them long enough to note them down.

### 5 a.m. Nepholopsia

> Oliver loved words so much, he often dreamed of them, and sometimes dreamed them up. One morning, six years ago, I found a phrase he’d written on the white board in the kitchen. All it said was “5 a.m. Nepholopsia.”

Do you ever struggle to find the right words? Does it delight you when you can finally take hold of the word that's been on the tip of your tongue for seconds, minutes, weeks? I've been admiring the way Oliver Sacks could absorb himself into imaginary worlds through his [love of words](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/opinion/oliver-sacks-the-man-who-loved-words.html). At the other end of the spectrum, I'm reminded of David Lynch's stark, gnomic mantras—“This is the girl!”:
